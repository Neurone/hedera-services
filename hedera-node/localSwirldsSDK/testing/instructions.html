<h1>Running experiments on a set of AWS instances</h1>

Do the following to start up the AWS instances, run a set of experiments, and stop the instances.
Multiple experiments can be run, and the results from each will end up in a different directory with a different timestamp in the name.

<h2>Setting up the eviroment (only needed first time)</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure that the scripts in this directory are executable, by running <span
				style="color:blue;">chmod +x *.sh</span> in a bash console
		</li>
		<li>Install AWS CLI (<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">installation
			instructions</a>)
		</li>
		<li>Do an AWS CLI quick configuration and MAKE SURE to set the "Default output format" to "<span
				style="color:red;">text</span>"
			(<a target="_blank"
				href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-quick-configuration">quick
				configuration instructions</a>)
		</li>
		<li>
			Run <span style="color:blue;">openssl version</span> in a bash console to see if OpenSSL is installed.
			If not, you must install OpenSSL before continuing, the installation is platform specific.
			On most linux systems the following commands will work:
			<span style="color:blue;">apt-get install openssl</span> or <span
				style="color:blue;">yum install openssl</span>
		</li>
		<li>Run <span style="color:blue;">./generateKeyPair.sh</span> from a bash console to generate a key pair for
			accessing AWS instances via SSH
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Configuring the tests and running</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Edit the _config.sh file and specify the tests you want to run as well as the AWS instances you want to
				start
			</li>
			<li>Run <span style="color:blue;">./createSpotFleetAndRunTests.sh</span> from a bash console</li>
			<li>Once the script is done, there will be a results directory with all the statistics</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>WARNING</h1>
		These scripts start AWS instances that are not free. If anything goes wrong with the script, it might end with
		the instances still running.
		So, after the script ends, <b>always</b> log into AWS and verify that the instances were terminated. Failure to
		do that could be <b>very</b> expensive.
